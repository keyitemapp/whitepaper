# Game Development and Integration

If you are a UE engineer with a special game, you can integrate it into KeyItem. Developing a game with someone can lead to something beyond your imagination. It's an exciting event, essential for us creators. If you are an UnrealEngine engineer, you can get a chance to integrate your developed mini-game into KeyItem by providing me with the game's project file.

Alternatively, you can directly connect your game to the KEYITEM economy by using the planned KEYITEM protocol.

If your developed game is connected to KEYITEM, you can earn a 5% reward from the economy created by that game.

The more attractive games we gather, the more active the KeyItem community will become, and the greater the value circulated in the KeyItem economy. A portion of the gathered BSV will be used carefully for world peace.

We aim for a sustainable Win-Win relationship for developers, players, and society.
