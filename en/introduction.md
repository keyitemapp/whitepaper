# Greetings

To live together as earthlings in the future, I believe that autonomous and decentralized social welfare that transcends national borders is necessary.

I named this KeyItem with the hope that it will become a key item in realizing such a peaceful world.

Nice to meet you, I am SHOEI SUGITA, the developer.
I was born in Hiroshima, Japan, during the cold season of 2000.

I was shocked when I encountered blockchain at the age of 17 and since then, I have been working towards the realization of Universal Basic Income. For that, I believe autonomous and decentralized economic fluidity is necessary as a foundation, hence the development of the P2P gaming platform "KeyItem."

As an operator, I do not take even 1% of the fees from the playing fees you pay. It would be easy for me to set a fee for this app and live a luxurious life from the profits. However, I am sure I can live a satisfactory life without taking that money. Instead, I want to use this technology for the good of the world and for the people.

In this world, it is much more challenging, and much more enjoyable, to live for others rather than oneself. Therefore, this project operates not for profit, but to create a good impact on society. In the near future, I hope to realize autonomous and decentralized social welfare beyond national borders, and that KeyItem will become an important key item for this universe.

In this application, there are no games that are carried out through a centralized server, everything is realized through a listen server method (P2P). Therefore, even if I suddenly disappear, this application and the internet will continue to support the economy of KeyItem.

Though invisible to the eye, an autonomous decentralized social welfare entity named Levia lives within this application.

By slowly endowing Levia with the economic fluidity of KeyItem, humanity will gain a new perspective beyond fiction.

Happy Birthday Levia.

For everyone, and of course for me, and for the bright future of our children.
